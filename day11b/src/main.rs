// The following isn't that relevant to my solution, but
// I'll offer it here nonetheless.
//
// The number of denary digits of a number is given by:
// floor(log10(n)) + 1
//
// The number of denary digits of a number after multiplying
// it by 2024 is given by: floor(log10(n) + log10(2024)) + 1
//
// Note that log10(2024) < 3.31.
//
// To calculate floor(log10(n) + log10(2024)), we can add
// the integer part and the decimal part separately. If the
// decimal part is less than one, it has no effect, and the
// answer is the sum of the integer parts. If it is equal to
// one one or more, the answer is the sum of the integer
// parts plus one.
//
// (If four digits are added to a numeral with an odd number
// of digits, it remains with an odd number of digits. If
// three are added, the number of digits becomes even.)
//
// This means that a number that has just been multiplied by
// 2024 and that remains with an odd number of digits must
// have a logarithmic fractional part smaller than 3.31.
// This is because its fractional part before multiplying
// was less than 1 â€”well, it's fractional after all!
//
// This is how we know that you have to multiply a number
// with an odd number of digits at most twice by 2024 to get
// a number with an even number of digits.
//
// If this explanation isn't clear, I am sorry. I could try
// clarifying it later, though frankly I would be very
// surprised if I actually did.
//
// Other intuitive explanations might exist. I don't know.
// For example, log10(2024^2) < 6.62.
